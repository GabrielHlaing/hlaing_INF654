Recipe & Meal Planner PWA

Overview:
This Recipe & Meal Planner is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) prototype designed to help users save their favorite recipes, plan meals for the week, and generate grocery lists. The project showcases a responsive design built with the Materialize CSS framework, ensuring a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
The application consists of three primary pages:

1. Home Page (index.html): Introduction to the app, with navigation to the Recipes and Planner sections.
2. Recipes Page (recipe.html): A collection of recipes where users can explore and save their favorite meals.
3. Meal Planner Page (planner.html): A simple interface for users to plan meals for the week and prepare grocery lists.

Viewing the Prototype:
The PWA prototype can be navigated using the buttons on the navigation bar or the cards on the Home page. 
The navigation bar, cards, and all other contents are responsive to the window size. The buttons are clickable but lack functionality because JS has still not been implemented. 

Technologies Used:
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Materialize Framework)
* JavaScript (for future interactivity and PWA functionality)
